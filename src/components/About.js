          Greenfields Community Church (Registered Charity No. 1104323) has been a vibrant and welcoming part of the community since its founding in 1994. Our church initially gathered in a former Welsh independent chapel building, located in a prominent and strategic position near Morriston Hospital. This location not only reflects our rich heritage but also symbolizes our mission to serve as a beacon of hope and care for all those in the local area.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As a church, we are committed to creating a welcoming, Christ-centered community that embraces people from all walks of life. Our vision is to share the love of God and offer practical support, spiritual guidance, and fellowship to everyone. Whether through worship, community outreach, or simply offering a place for people to come together, we strive to live out our faith in a way that positively impacts the lives of those around us.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Greenfields Community Church offers a range of activities, including weekly services, Bible study groups, childrenâ€™s programs, and various community outreach initiatives. We believe that the church should be a safe, nurturing place where people can grow in faith, connect with others, and make a difference in the world.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We welcome you to join us, whether you are seeking spiritual growth, fellowship, or a deeper connection with God. At Greenfields, you will find a loving and supportive church family eager to journey with you in faith.
